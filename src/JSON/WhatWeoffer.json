    "description":"In 2013, BrewDog founders Watt and Dickie starred in their own TV series, “Brew Dogs,” on the former Esquire network. It was cancelled after three seasons. They didn’t stop there: BrewDog launched its own streaming service, the BrewDog Network, in 2018. The subscription-based service offers “over 100 hours of drink and lifestyle content, including original series you can’t find anywhere else.” It launched with a tongue-in-cheek, porn-themed campaign that, perhaps unsurprisingly, didn’t go over too well."}
